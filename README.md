# 8_Ball_Project_Python
This Python code simulates a Magic 8-Ball fortune-telling experience. Here's a summary of its functionality:

  **Initialization:**
        Sets the variables name to "jack," question to "Do I win the Lottery," and answer to an empty string.
        Imports the random module to generate a random number.

  **Random Answer Generation:**
        Generates a random number (random_number) between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
        Uses an if-elif-else structure to assign an answer based on the generated random number.

  **Prints Magic 8-Ball Response:**
        Checks if the variable name is not an empty string.
            If true, prints the name, the asked question, and the Magic 8-Ball's answer.
            If false, prints the question and the Magic 8-Ball's answer.

  **Additional Message Handling:**
        Checks if the variable question is an empty string.
            If true, prints a message indicating that the Magic 8-Ball is patiently waiting for a question.

This code essentially emulates the experience of asking the Magic 8-Ball a question, receiving a random answer, and printing the interaction details.
